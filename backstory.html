<h3>A Crummy Internship</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1998, I had a terrible summer internship.  It was the summer between my junior and senior year at MIT where I was studying Mechanical Engineering, and I was so pleased to have gotten a position at a “real” engineering firm for the first time.  After selling cutlery for a summer and working in an underground lab at MIT that gave me a cough for a decade, it was time to try a real corporate product design job.</p>

<p>This company in Warwick, Rhode Island will remain nameless. But my job required sitting in a cubicle 40 hours a week, rarely talking to another human, designing detailed mechanical parts in 3D.  Back in 1998 the computers were so slow at doing this that you literally had two workstations in your cubicle.  You would fillet a curve in your model on one computer and then, while it took a few minutes to render that change, you roll your chair over to a separate computer where you could do email or whatever else while you waited for the software to catch up.</p>  

<p>I was 20 years old and designing the rubber boots that protect a portable printer from a fall.  Maybe you've picked up a rental car at an airport and a person printed a receipt for you right out in the parking garage… that printer clipped to their belt is covered with a rubber casing to protect it from a fall onto the concrete.  Well, I may very well have designed that rubber boot. Rough summer.  I decided this is not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life.  There must be something more fun I can do with my education.</p>


<h3>IAAPA Show 1998</h3>

<p>A roommate in my fraternity house at MIT and I started looking at options and industries that were off the beaten path.  Perhaps every mechanical engineering student at one point thinks about rollercoasters, and so we stumbled upon IAAPA – the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. </p>

<p>IAAPA has a monster trade show each November, generally in Orlando (though in 1998 it was in Dallas, where my roommate was from – free room & board!)  This tradeshow is the industry gathering place for anyone buying or selling to the attraction industry.  Everyone from the plush you’d win at your county fair to the cotton candy machines to the consultants and designers who create the world’s largest and most exciting location-based entertainment (LBE) projects.  There are rollercoasters and themed environments everywhere, over 1,000 companies make an appearance.</p>

<p>Back in ‘98 there was no concept of student admissions (or the current “Next Gen” program) so the organizers didn’t really know how to classify two 21-year old students.  When we got our name badges to enter the show floor, they just said “BUYER” in bold letters.  That worked out well.  We could walk up to any of the booths, flash that buyer nameplate, and ask to talk to the highest ranking person there.  When that person came over, I’d whip out a resume with a big M - I - T on the top, and ended up having a couple dozen mini-interviews in the span of a few days on the IAAPA show floor.</p>

<p>Both my roommate and I scored further interviews and eventually job offers from that show floor walk.  One of the clearest tactical pieces of advice I offer when college students ask for advice: if you know an industry you are interested in, go to their tradeshow.  Just about every niche field has an annual gathering – if you want to work in cars, go to the car show.  There is a trade gathering for nearly every industry.  You can make connections, land interviews, and importantly begin to really understand the big players and how your target industry really works.</p>


<h3>Starting a career in Living Color</h3>

<p>I landed an interview with a young, growing company called Living Color Enterprises, in Fort Lauderdale, FL.</p>






<h3>This Career Story is still being written</h3>
<p>... in more ways than one!</p>
<p>Additional narrative still in progress… filler below.</p>
